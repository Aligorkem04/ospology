## OSPOLogy Live Mission & Startegic Goals

This document is intended to serve as a guide for OSPOlogy Live audience and organizers to have an allignment and
better understanding on the initiative's mission and goals for 2023.

From now on *we* will refer to OSPOlogyLive Organizers, that includes representatives form the following open source
projects and foundations: OpenSSF, OpenChain, TODO Group, InnerSource Commons, CHAOSS, SPDX and LF Energy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Proposal

OSPOlogy Live Europe is an annual event that brings together open source program office (OSPO) local and international practitioners
to share knowledge and existing projects across open soruce communities, discuss emerging trends, and collaborate on best practices in OSPOs for
specific region needs.

### ðŸ¤” Why OSPOlogyLive Europe?

Open Source adoption and perception has a different story across regions. In Europe for instance, 
there are several factors that can explain why the differences on adoption of free software in 
organizations in Europe.

* **Legal framework:** In several European countries, there is specific legislation on the use 
use of free software in the public sphere, which has promoted its adoption in government administrations 
and state agencies.

* **Motivators:** In general, the tech culture in Europe is more likely to value privacy and security. In other regions such as United States, the technological culture focuses 
more on innovation and the market.

* **Organizational culture:** In general, organizations in Europe tend to be conservative in adopting new technologies 
and cautious in terms of risks and investment in technology. 

* **Transition efforts:** European organizations can highly rely on proprietary software, 
and the transition to free software may require significant investment in staff training and adaptation of processes and systems. 
In addition, some proprietary software providers have adopted business strategies that hinder the adoption of free software, 
such as the use of closed formats or the lack of interoperability.

These and other factors has shaped the adoption of open source wihtin organizations within Europe. Because of this,
we believe is important to promote the adoption of Open Source entities (called OSPOs) based on specific region needs, and 
provide a secure space where local and international OSPO practitioners and open source experts from different communities
collaborate and corss-share information to avoid duplicated efforts.

## ðŸ§© Strategic goals Proposal

> NOTE: Strategic goals needs to be reviewed and approved by OSPOlogy organizers first. This is just a proposal.

Dear OSPOlogy Organizers:

Here is a set of potential strategic goals for OSPOlogy Live in 2023, based on past workshops, community feedbak, and 
and emerging trends in the field of open source program offices (OSPOs):

1. **Expand the scope of OSPOlogy Live with the presence of more organizations**: While past OSPOlogy Live events have been successful in engaging the
open source community, we believe there is potential to reach an even wider audience. 
In 2023, we propose to explore partnerships with other organizations and communities that are working on related topics, 
such as open data, open government, and open science.

2. **Showcase emerging trends and best practices in OSPOs from partner communities:** The field of OSPOs is constantly evolving, 
and there are always new tools, techniques, and approaches to explore. In 2023, we propose to showcase 
emerging trends, existing projects and best practices in OSPOs, including topics such as security, open data, compliance, governance, 
and community management.

3. **Encourage more diversity and inclusion in OSPOlogy:** 
In 2023, we propose to make diversity and inclusion a central theme 
of OSPOlogy Live, and to ensure that the event is accessible to a wide range of regions and sectors.

We believe that these strategic goals will help to make OSPOlogy Live an even more valuable and impactful event for the open source community. 
We welcome your feedback and look forward to working with you to make OSPOlogy Live 2023 a success.
