## About OSPOlogy Live

OSPOlogy Live is a series of conferences designed as interactive lectures and breakout rooms that aim to connect open source program office (OSPO) professionals from both local and international spheres. The events facilitate the exchange of knowledge and information on existing projects within open source communities, as well as provide a platform to discuss emerging trends and collaborate on best practices in OSPOs tailored to the specific needs of each region.

* Current efforts are being done in Europe, wiht the aim to expando to other countries in upcomming years.

## Problem statement

The OSPO movement is expanding across industries and regions of all types and sizes. Due to the wide range of responsibilities and ways to operate, OSPO professionals usually find it difficult when it comes to implementing OSPO best practices, policies, processes, or tools for their open source management efforts.

## Introducing OSPOlogy workshop

We are introducing a new framework for hybrid small-scale conference targeted to discuss important topics for OSPOs. This format provides a more intimate and interactive setting for participants to engage in discussions, share knowledge, and build relationships with like-minded professionals.

This way, people can talk openly about their organization's open source challenges and work together on shared solutions. The workshop initiative aims to bring together the various communities involved in OSPO-specific topics to help organizations effectively implement OSPO Programs based on specific region needs.

Topics range from safely using open source to license compliance, sustainability, contributing back to the community, and more. For the full list of OSPO-specific topics please see [https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/).

### The workshop framework

In a nutshell, the framework defines the following workshop:

- Follows an unconference style meaning it's a participants-driven meeting
- Aim is to share openly and learn from each other under Chatham house rule and connect OSPOs with various open source communities involved in the open source activities that matter to them (e.g. os policies, tooling, standards, and community building)
- It is a 2-day in-person event, part prepared presentations, part hands-on workshop, and of course, there is space for networking.
- Is under Linux Foundation policies and code of conduct
- Participants can register their interest to receive an invite via [Linux Foundation&#39;s community platform](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group-europe/) as seats are limited.
- Location is to be provided by one of the participants for free
- Each participant pays for their own food, travel, and lodging. Lunch and dinners may be free if workshop organizers find sponsors.
- Linux Foundation and TODO group can help with promoting the workshops via various communication channels (social media, mailing lists, newsletters, etc.).

### Unconference style

Typically at an unconference, the agenda of the workshop part is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space.

OSPOlogy workshops are not fully an unconference as the first day is a series of prepared presentations so you know the sessions before joining (1 or 2 will be participants chosen). For Day 2 the workshop is the unconference part where participants vote on topics to be worked on that day. Participants may be asked to submit their topic before the workshop to accelerate/simplify the voting process.

### Suggested agenda sections

Every OSPOlogy Live is slightly different bassed on the micro-conference theme and region needs. However, these are some common areas that a OSPOlogy host and organizers can start discussing when defining an OSPOlogy Live session:

* OSPO Use Cases: This section will consist of expert-led panels or talks that share experiences and case studies from specific OSPOs. The aim is to provide insights and inspiration from successful OSPOs to help others improve their own programs.

* OSPO Accelerators: This section will highlight specific activities within [INSERT PROJECT NAME], such as outcomes of recent community activities. The aim is to give people insights into various topics the communities are working on and gather feedback and contributions from the audience.

* Shared Challenges Assessment: In this section, we will identify shared challenges and pain points on the OSPO mind map, and let the audience vote for the areas of interest to form working groups. The focus areas can be specific activities within OSPO responsibilities, and the goal is to encourage collaboration and problem-solving.

* Breakout Sessions: During the breakout sessions, participants will define goals and identify pain points related to their chosen focus area. Each breakout group aims to capture their challenges and document their experiences and solutions if possible, to share with the wider OSPO community.

* Networking / Social 

## Key actors, Host selection criteria and requirements

### Key actors description

OSPOlogy Live involves two key actors: the organizing team and the venue host. 

* **The organizing team** is responsible for planning and executing the micro-conference, including setting the agenda, finding speakers, and managing logistics. The team is coordinated by Ana and Thomas.

* **The venue host,** on the other hand, provides the physical location for the event and sponsors the cost of the venue. The host is an integral part of the organizing team, working closely with the team to ensure the micro-conference runs smoothly.

It's worth noting that the organizing team and the venue host may be the same entity or individual, depending on the circumstances.

### How host selection criteria works

To ensure that the event meets our project direction and values, we require a formal proposal (email sent to organizers) from potential hosts. Please review the following requirements and recommendations when submitting your proposal:

* Your organizations is an active Open Source Contributor: Hosts must be actively contributing to open source projects to be eligible for consideration.

* Size and Industry Diversity: We are looking for hosts that represent a diverse range of organizaiton sizes (small, medium and large) and industries to provide a well-rounded perspective on open source.

* OSPO Preferred Choice: Hosts with an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) are preferred, as they demonstrate a commitment to open source.

* Easy Accessibility: Hosts should be located in an easily accessible location to ensure that attendees can travel to and from the event with ease.

### Recommendations:

* Record Presentations: We highly recommend that hosts allow set up to record presentations to allow for hybrid formats and make the content accessible to a broader audience.

The organizing committee will review all proposals to ensure that they fit within the project direction and values. We reserve the right to have the final word on selecting a host for OSPOlogyLive.

## Responsibilities

The OSPOlogy Live organizing team is responsible for a variety of tasks, including:

* Requests: Reviewing and approving/declining workshop requests submitted by potential presenters. All voting is conducted via a two-thirds majority of OSPOlogy Live organizers. In the event of conflict resolution, the TODO Steering Committee will have final oversight of the proposed workshop.

* Venue Host: Identifying and coordinating with the OSPOlogy host to secure a meeting room for the event.
