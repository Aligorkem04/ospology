> If you are interested in joining TODO / OSPOlogy working groups, please find the one that better fits your timezone in the todogroup.org/community calendar. We
also host TODO Touchpoint calls (AKA open office hours) to explore common challenges in OSPO day-to-day operations across different organizations.

- ✨ Find more OSPO insights within the TODO’s Guides and additional OSPO resources.

- 🧐 Do you have ideas on how to improve this newsletter? File an issue: https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/issues.

- 🫂 If you are new to TODO Group Community, make sure to visit TODO get started pages.

- 💚 Our General Members, OSPO Associates, and Ambassadors fuel TODO. Without their help and expertise, we would not be able to do the work we do. If your organization is interested in supporting the TODO Group, see more info here.
