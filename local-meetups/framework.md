## About OSPOlogy 
OSPOlogy is an initiative under the TODO group that offers best practice-sharing online workshops that are open to all, from folks starting their OSPOs to seasoned OPSOers! These sessions are typically led by a TODO member covering one topic or sharing their organization’s OSPO journey.
For further details see https://github.com/todogroup/ospology.

## Problem statement
TODO Group members requested local events to find and network with OSPOers near their area, to different OSPO topics.
