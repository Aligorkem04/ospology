# Existing Literature & Resources

* The guide will include a comprehensive review of existing literature and resources on open source and Open Source Program Offices, including reports, articles, whitepapers, and books.

* The guide will also provide a list of essential resources that organizations can use to further their understanding of open source and OSPOs, including online courses, webinars, and industry events.

* Additionally, the guide will highlight key organizations and initiatives that are leading the way in open source and OSPOs, providing organizations with a network of resources and support as they navigate their open source journey.

This section will provide organizations with a comprehensive list of the existing literature and resources available on open source and OSPOs, making it easy for them to access the information and support they need to create and implement an OSPO successfully.
