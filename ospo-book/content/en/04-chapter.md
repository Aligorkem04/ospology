# Introduction

Understanding the day-to-day activities of those managing open source operations within an organization is important for several reasons. First and foremost, it sheds light on the fundamental tasks that an OSPO must focus on to ensure the organization's technology strategy and efforts align with open source best practices. This knowledge helps to streamline engineering processes and maintain compliance with open source licenses and security measures.

OSPO day-to-day operations encompass a broad spectrum of activities aimed at enhancing open source engagement and compliance within the organization, including:

- **Personalized Technical Support:** Involves answering questions on all aspects of open source, including license
  compliance, selecting open source software, and interactions with vendors. It also includes engaging with the
  community and partners, securing sponsorships, and organizing open source events.
  
- **Automation tools:** Efficiency in process automation is key because policies alone may not always be effective as
  they are not always followed. Managers are usually seeking effective options for automation tooling, including for
  security automation and reporting, such as the integration of scorecards.

- **Documentation, Training, and Education:** Crucial to ensure that individuals are qualified to assess projects.
  Developing training materials and documentation and aiding teams to produce these across different departments are key
  tasks.

- **Resource Allocation:** Requires a strategic approach to prioritize effectively.

- **Risk Management:** Involves assessing the risks the organization faces. Obtaining a comprehensive view of the
  organization's tech stack, such as generating SBOMs, and considering software from vendors, legacy software, and
  proprietary software is crucial. This is more about a business assessment perspective rather than just data gathering.
  Decisions need to be made on whether to optimize SBOMs or to allocate time to other areas.

- **Sponsoring Open Source Communities and Foundations:** Providing insights into the dynamics and complexities of open
  source governance and models is part of this.

- **Measuring Technical Debt:** In open source projects requires understanding maturity and governance models.

- **Coordinate with Various Parts of the Organization:** Map interactions with teams based on the OSPO flower diagram,
  distinguishing between technical questions (engineering) and non-technical questions (business, design team).

- **Advise on open source consumpiton** define a set of advices about how the company should select what open source is
  consumed and how the consumption is made. Advices can be purely technical or considerations based on open source
  project health and practices, like the
  [Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F)](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/blob/main/specification/Secure_Supply_Chain_Consumption_Framework_(S2C2F).pdf).

## Assessing Daily Operations

### Getting started with OSPO MindMap

To get an overview of the potential activities an OSPO can handle, we recommend first examining the OSPO Mind Map. The OSPO Mind Map outlines the main responsibilities, roles, behaviors, and team sizes within the ecosystem of an Open Source Program Office.

### OSPO MindMap Limitations

The contributors to this book have identified challenges in implementing the mind map, particularly in filtering responsibilities based on the organization's level of open source engagement. Because of this, the aim of this chapter is to provide an in-depth classification of these activities, grouped by levels of open source engagement. This book uses Ibrahim H.'s open source activity engagement modelâ€”previously seen in Chapter 2â€”as it is less complex and not focused on corporate structures.

For open source there are several options, buying it from a vendor or a service provider, doing the support yourself with the help of the community (being responsible here what to expect from a community), or also going with the risk of not having support for scenarios where the risk of not having support is low. |

## Recommendations (TBD)

### The OSPO should have secured resources for strategic contributions

- Scope: If the company has strategic targets related to open source, its OSPO should be capable to control resources to
  drive the execution of the strategy.

- Recommendation: To ensure the continuity of contributions needed for the strategy execution the OSPO should either:
    - Have a set of dedicated open source developers
    - Have a budget for company internal development resources asigned to startegic OSPO tasks
    - Have a budget to hire external developers to work on the startegic OSPO tasks
