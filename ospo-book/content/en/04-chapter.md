# Introduction

Understanding the day-to-day activities of those managing open source operations within an organization is crucial for several reasons. First and foremost, it sheds light on the fundamental tasks that an OSPO must focus on to ensure the organization's 
technology strategy and aefforts aligns with open source best practices. This knowledge helps to streamline engineering processes and maintain compliance with open source licenses and security measures.

OSPO day-to-day operations encompass a broad spectrum of activities aimed at enhancing open source engagement and compliance within the organization, including providing personalized technical support on licensing and software selection, leveraging automation tools for process efficiency and security, 
developing and disseminating educational materials, strategically allocating resources, managing risks through comprehensive assessments of the tech stack, sponsoring and engaging with open source communities and foundations, measuring technical debt in projects, and facilitating coordination 
across various organizational divisions to align both technical and non-technical objectives.

- **Personalized Technical Support:** Involves answering questions on all aspects of open source, including license compliance, selecting open source software, and interactions with vendors. It also includes engaging with the community and partners, securing sponsorships, and organizing open source events.
  
- **Automation tools:** Efficiency in process automation is key because policies alone may not always be effective as they are not always followed. Managers are usually seeking effective options for automation tooling,
including for security automation and reporting, such as the integration of scorecards.

- **Documentation, Training, and Education:** Crucial to ensure that individuals are qualified to assess projects. Developing training materials and documentation and aiding teams to produce these across different departments are key tasks.

- **Resource Allocation:** Requires a strategic approach to prioritize effectively.

- **Risk Management:** Involves assessing the risks the organization faces. Obtaining a comprehensive view of the organization's tech stack, such as generating SBOMs, and considering software from vendors, legacy software, and proprietary software is crucial. This is more about a business assessment perspective rather than just data gathering. Decisions need to be made on whether to optimize SBOMs or to allocate time to other areas.

- **Sponsoring Open Source Communities and Foundations:** Providing insights into the dynamics and complexities of open source governance and models is part of this.

- **Measuring Technical Debt:** In open source projects requires understanding maturity and governance models.

- **Coordinate with Various Parts of the Organization:** Map interactions with teams based on the OSPO flower diagram, distinguishing between technical questions (engineering) and non-technical questions (business, design team).


## Assessing Daily Operations

This section presents a detailed overview of the operational considerations necessary for managing open source initiatives within organizations. This section is structured to cover several key areas: the core reasons for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) to prioritize specific tasks, the tangible benefits these tasks 
provide to the organization, the scope of engagement with open source in terms of usage and contribution, and an inventory of tools and services that support these efforts.

## Recommendations

`ðŸ’¡Recommendations`

### Scenario #11

Social Engineering Attack on Upstream xz/liblzma: A social engineering attack targeted the xz/liblzma, an essential open source library. The attack was meticulously planned, gaining trust within the community before executing a malicious attack. This incident was discovered inadvertently by an unrelated project, underscoring the sophistication and stealthiness of such vulnerabilities. The challenge for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) lies in identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities, which are not always apparent until after they occur. Despite existing procedures and policies, OSPOs recognize the need for mechanisms to proactively measure and respond to such threats.

> Recommendation
>
> 1. SBOMs Compliance Ready: Ensure that all software components are documented through Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). This documentation helps in quickly identifying potentially compromised components once a vulnerability is disclosed.
> 
> 2. Automation Security Checks: Implement automated security checks, such as the OpenSSF Security Scorecard, to continuously evaluate the security posture of projects. This proactive measure can highlight vulnerabilities or anomalies that merit further investigation.
> 
> 3. Having a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) within the organization and having the OSPO collaborate closely with them. This specialized team should be equipped with the tools and authority to respond swiftly to security incidents. Pre-existing relationships within the team facilitate rapid internal communication about the > > severity of incidents.
> 
> 4. Scorecard Management: Keep security and vulnerability scorecards up to date. These scorecards should reflect the latest security checks and assessments, helping in quick decision-making during a crisis.
> 
> 5. Automated Feedback Loops: Develop well-automated feedback loops for bug reporting and fixing. Knowing who is responsible for addressing a particular bug and ensuring that this process is as automated as possible can significantly reduce response times.

### Scenario #12

OSPOs face the challenge of navigating license changes and assessing software trustworthiness. As projects like Redis have shown, altering license terms can have significant implications for use, distribution, and contribution. These changes needs clear communication and understanding of the roles and responsibilities dictated by new license terms. Furthermore, OSPOs are tasked with evaluating the trustworthiness of software, which can vary based on whether a project is maintained by a single vendor or hosted under a foundation. For instance, The Almalinux Foundation presents a case where donating a project to a foundation mitigated risks associated with single-vendor governance, thereby enhancing trust in the project.

> Recommendation
>
> 1. Educational Initiatives on License Implications: Develop educational materials and sessions for developers and users within the organization to understand the nuances of different licenses. This understanding will help them make informed decisions when using or contributing to open-source projects.
>
> 2. Explicit License Terms: Work with legal teams to ensure that license terms are as explicit and unambiguous as possible. Clear terms help in avoiding misunderstandings and potential legal conflicts.
> 
> 3. Software Trust Rating System: Implement a system to evaluate and rate the trustworthiness of software, considering factors like governance structure, maintenance practices, and community engagement. Projects hosted under reputable foundations could be rated higher for trustworthiness due to the oversight and governance provided.
> 
> 4. Encourage Foundation Hosted Projects: Advocate for donating projects to foundations to mitigate risks associated with single-vendor control. Highlight successful cases like Almalinux to illustrate the benefits of this approach, such as increased trust and community support.
> 
> 5. Stakeholder Engagement in License Decisions: Engage a broad range of stakeholders, including developers, legal advisors, and end-users, in discussions about license changes or the adoption of new projects. Their insights can help in making balanced decisions that align with the organization's values and risk tolerance
