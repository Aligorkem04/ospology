Both organizations and the open source ecosystem are confronted with new challenges and opportunities, driven by regulatory changes, evolving licensing models, and increased public sector engagement. This chapter delves into these challenges within the open source, shedding light on common situations and pain points that are shaping the future of how organizations integrate open source in their IT operations and Technology Stack.

## Sustainability of Stewards in OSS

Content has been curated from the [OSPOlogyLive Apeldoorn Roundtable Discussion](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions/438#discussioncomment-8619964) and based on the CRA Definition of Steward.

### Government Funding Challenges
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

An ongoing challenge in governments is the inherent difficulty governments face in allocating funds for resources that are available for free. There is a strategic interest from governments to support OSS, but hurdles exist, including the potential complications arising from direct financial requests. This underscores the need for exploring alternative support infrastructures for stewardship organizations without directly soliciting government funding.

### The Commons Dilemma
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

The tragedy of the commons is notably present in the OSS world, where disproportionate consumption by certain users exacerbates sustainability issues. Discussions suggested the need to strength infrastructure support to mitigate these disparities and ensure a more balanced contribution and consumption (also called usage) model within the OSS community.

### Community Norms and Funding Strategies
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

Establishing community norms around the costs associated with SBOM delivery and compliance has been proposed as an idea. This could involve suggesting a donation model based on organization size to account for the rising costs of compliance. Additionally, the role of risk mitigation as a motivation for organizations to invest in OSS was discussed, alongside the potential for government agencies to contribute indirectly to OSS projects through third parties.

### Policy and Funding Initiatives
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

The possibility of the EU mandating open source as a requirement for Horizon funding suggests a growing recognition of the value of OSS at the policy level. There is an ongoing discussion on strategic funding models, like the German sovereign tech fund, and the potential for government roles in supporting OSS.

### Challenges in OSS Sustainability

The underfunding of crucial projects like Django, and the broader issue of maintainers being underpaid or volunteering, underscores the sustainability challenges within OSS. The critical role of vulnerability management and the need for corporate contributions to OSS have been highlighted as areas requiring attention and action.

### Training and Education as Funding Avenues
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

The potential for integrating OSS training within government contracts is seen as a mean to provide both funding for OSS organizations and valuable training for employees. This represents an approach to leveraging existing procurement processes to support OSS sustainability.


## Building an Open Source Foundation for Container Capabilities

Content has been curated from the [OSPOlogyLive Apeldoorn Roundtable Discussion](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions/438#discussioncomment-8620412) and based on the adoption of open source software (OSS) for container orchestration, particularly Kubernetes, and its implications for IT strategy in organizations.

### OSPOs working with Container Hosting Infrastructure Teams

Teams dedicated to this infrastructure, focusing on aspects such as image repositories and platform enablement, collaborate closely with OSPOs to support container infrastructure and capabilities. Initiatives like the Cloud Platform Engineering Team (CPET) has beem highlighted for their efforts in publishing self-built operators, such as the Platform as a Service (PaaS) Operator, which automates tasks like initiating namespaces or projects on Kubernetes platforms.

#### Commercial vs. Open Source for Kubernetes Deployment

A central point of debate was the choice between adhering to premium advisors' recommendations for using commercial services for Kubernetes deployment versus exploring open source alternatives. Given the wide array of Kubernetes distributions, this decision involves complex considerations. The discussion emphasized the importance of finding a middle ground that appreciates the advantages of OSS while also recognizing the ethical imperative to contribute to its sustainability.

### Choosing Additional OSS Capabilities
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

The criteria for integrating additional OSS capabilities into commercial Kubernetes platforms include the popularity of the OSS, the contributor community's size, vendor support, adherence to standards such as OpenTelemetry, and alignment with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) ecosystem. Concerns are raised about copyright control and the potential pitfalls of centralized code ownership.

### Maturity and Reliability of OSS for Enterprise Use

Ongoing discussion on the maturity and reliability of OSS for meeting enterprise needs for speed, robustness, and reliability. It has been acknowledged that while commercial vendors might offer support, success is not guaranteed. The necessity for organizations to have skilled teams capable of navigating the complexities of container orchestration and Kubernetes to maintain operational resilience was stressed.
