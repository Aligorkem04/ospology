## Sustainability of Stewards in OSS

Content has been curated from the [OSPOlogyLive Apeldoorn Roundtable Discussion](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions/438#discussioncomment-8619964) and based on the CRA Definition of Steward.

### Government Funding Challenges
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

An ongoing challenge in governments is the inherent difficulty governments face in allocating funds for resources that are available for free. There is a strategic interest from governments to support OSS, but hurdles exist, including the potential complications arising from direct financial requests. This underscores the need for exploring alternative support infrastructures for stewardship organizations without directly soliciting government funding.

### The Commons Dilemma
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

The tragedy of the commons is notably present in the OSS world, where disproportionate consumption by certain users exacerbates sustainability issues. Discussions suggested the need to strength infrastructure support to mitigate these disparities and ensure a more balanced contribution and consumption (also called usage) model within the OSS community.

### Community Norms and Funding Strategies
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

Establishing community norms around the costs associated with SBOM delivery and compliance has been proposed as an idea. This could involve suggesting a donation model based on organization size to account for the rising costs of compliance. Additionally, the role of risk mitigation as a motivation for organizations to invest in OSS was discussed, alongside the potential for government agencies to contribute indirectly to OSS projects through third parties.

### Policy and Funding Initiatives
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

The possibility of the EU mandating open source as a requirement for Horizon funding suggests a growing recognition of the value of OSS at the policy level. There is an ongoing discussion on strategic funding models, like the German sovereign tech fund, and the potential for government roles in supporting OSS.

### Challenges in OSS Sustainability

The underfunding of crucial projects like Django, and the broader issue of maintainers being underpaid or volunteering, underscores the sustainability challenges within OSS. The critical role of vulnerability management and the need for corporate contributions to OSS have been highlighted as areas requiring attention and action.

### Training and Education as Funding Avenues
`üèõ Social-Gov-Oriented`

The potential for integrating OSS training within government contracts is seen as a mean to provide both funding for OSS organizations and valuable training for employees. This represents an approach to leveraging existing procurement processes to support OSS sustainability.
