### EMEA &APAC Meeting Notes

Automation tools for OSPOs
- For example: toolings checking for license compliance 
- A lot of tools that you can use freely but there are also closed tools
- Implementation. How to do things efficiently, and how we automate processes.
- Policies might not work always (people don’t usually follow them) so automation tooling is important. 
- Security automation and reporting (e.g scorecards integration)
Define day-to-day operations based on the OSPO flower structure (e.g how to work with Business / legal compliance/security)
Measuring the performance of the activity
- Measuring the number of contributions that the company has been making to open source projects - something to develop also in chapter 6 (measuring)
Before brainstorming day-to-day issues, let’s define the *why*. Why is an organization focused on license compliance automation and hiring and setting up an OSPO to track that?
- for instance:  Open source usage = Lack of understanding from developers on how to understand open source licenses. Teaching and giving insights (e.g. if there are license violations, how to fix that).
The idea to divide Chapter 4 into two activities: routine vs yearly strategy
Discussion: Does strategy fit more in Chapter 2 or Chapter 4
- Need to unify Corporate Strategy versus Community Strategy
- It is important to let decision-makers understand the critical importance of supporting open source projects (and its community), foundations, etc
- Strategy is something that affects “daily”. Thus, it might fit in Chapter 4
Tools mentioned:
- OSFF Scorecard https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openssf-scorecard-monitor
- License checker for NPM ecosystem: https://github.com/onebeyond/license-checker

|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fundamental reasons for OSPOs to focus on this task | Streamline license management to facilitate easier discovery of licenses and minimize the approval processes required from developers when using open source tools. | Enable tools and best practices for integrating security measures, such as scorecards, into daily operations | Inform strategic adjustments and operational enhancements | A unified strategy influences daily operations |
| Perceived Value                     | Automation in license compliance reduces manual oversight, accelerates development workflows, and ensures compliance with open source licenses without burdening developers with lengthy approval processes | Automation in security practices and vulnerabilities exploration in open source projects allows effective risk management. | Measuring performance facilitate transparent assessment of the OSPO's effectiveness | Guiding decisions on contributions to open source projects, engagement with community initiatives, and the balancing of organization and community benefits |
| Using Open Source (Scope)           | Explore automation tools that assist developers in organizations in scanning and identifying open source licenses the can use, and speed up the compliance process. | Explore automation tools that assist developers to self-assess security risk on specific projects, without burdening them with lengthy approval processes | TBD (ping CHAOSS OSPO metrics WG to give input on this) | Enable decision makers understand the critical importance of supporting open source projects (and its community) and foundations, and the different ways to offer support |
| Contributing to Open Source (Scope) | Explore automation tools that assist developers in organizations in scanning and identifying open source licenses to projects they would like to contribute as employees, and speed up the compliance process. | Explore automation tools that assist developers to self-assess security risk on projects they would like to contribute as employees, without burdening them with lengthy approval processes | | frameworks that support strategic planning and execution |
