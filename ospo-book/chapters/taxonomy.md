# Taxonomy used for chapter navigation

Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) can be complex and diverse depending on their nature, organizational culture, goals, size, and more. 
To help readers quickly identify which sections of the book are most relevant to their interests, each chapter 
includes the following deliverables 

## 🔖 Tag System 
This shows the types of segments that the content is most relevant to. These segments are organized within 
three main pillars. These pillars are key areas that has indirect impact on the creation, evolution of the OSPO 
and its perceived value to the organization.

### [Pillar 1] Organizational Goals & Motivators

This pillar answers questions related to goal alignment and drivers of motivation.

**Goal Alignment**
Goal alignment refers to the process of aligning the goals and objectives of the OSPO
with the overall mission and purpose of the organization and those entities that shapes 
the organization (e.g government laws).

**Drivers of Motivation**
Motivation is the driving force that fuels people and entities to achieve their goals and 
reach their full potential.

**Common Questions**

* How my organization is structured?
* What is my organization trying to achieve with open source?
* Why are they investing in open source?

Collectively, the answers to these questions helps to understand to the reader
how open source is being utilized within an organization, and how it contributes 
to its overall success and mission.

Regardless of the type of organization, it is important for OSPO leaders and teams to understand the 
drivers of motivation for the actors they will interact with and align their goals with the overall 
mission of the organization.

It's important to note that these tags are not meant to be exclusive. 
Some chapters may be relevant to multiple types of OSPOs and multiple tags can be included. 

### [Pillar 2] Tasks, Communication, and Relationships

> RE ML disussion: https://lists.todogroup.org/g/ospo-book-project/message/5


This pillar focuses on the transmission of knowledge to different player who have a direct or indirect 
impact on the OSPO. It examines the OSPO in four different directions:

* `⬇️ Down`: as the head of an OSPO I need to manage what the OSPO team does. What do they do? That depends on the OSPO, but either way, there’s a basic need to manage a group. 

* `⬆️ Up`: as the head of a group (or someone proposing the creation of one) I need to manage expectations and needs with respect to my executive’s technology needs.

* `↔️ Sideways`: An OSPO need to work with others. For intance, in `business-oriented` OSPO, these include the dev tools team, the security team.  

* `🛸 Outside`: An OSPO represents the organization to the external communities and foundations. What is our method of integration?
