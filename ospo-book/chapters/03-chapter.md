## Introduction

In this chapter, we will introduce the key tasks and responsibilities of an open source program office (OSPO) on a day-to-day basis, 
as well as the core concepts to get started with a minimum viable OSPO. This includes the strategy aspect, layers of work, and pillars of support.

### Ingredients for a Minimum Viable OSPO

The first step in establishing an OSPO is to shape and build up the structure. This includes personnel, technology, and budget. It is also 
important to identify the key stakeholders in your organization who will be involved in open source activities.

The guide [A deep dive into OSPO](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices) explains all essential 
information on OSPO structures and operations.

Once this is evaluated, it is recommended to look at the OSPO from three different dimensions:

* The layers where the OSPO works and interacts
* The pillars where the OSPO provides support
* The strategy it will follow and its framework

### Layers of work for an OSPO

The area of work of your OSPO is also a crucial component to map, as it serves as one of the core ingredients for effectively implementing open source 
dynamics and philosophy on an organizational level. To achieve this, it is recommended to examine your own organizational architecture and break down 
open source tasks into four layers of work:

![ospo-layers](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/assets/43671777/03b224d5-9745-4581-ac36-0dbbda9a990d)

* **Worker / Employee Level:** This layer involves the people behind the OSPO to wor wiht individuals within the organization, wiht main focus on the intrinsic and extrinsic motivators of contributing 
 to open source from an individual point of view. It requires a cultural change effort and may involve activities such as establishing mentoring programs.

* **Management Level:** At this layer, the people behind the OSPO focus is on strategy and finding alignment between open source and the overall business / organizaiton strategy. Managers may face unique challenges, and leveraging the strengths of open source to help them solve these challenges can help address these issues effectively.

* **Business / Team Units Leve,:** This layer focuses on how the people behind the OSPO ensures all the pieces of the organization structure fit together. It involves sharing best practices across different business / Team units and fostering collaboration and knowledge transfer among them.

* **OSPO Level:** This is the inner side of the OSPO itself, where the people behind the OSPO works collectively to oversee and coordinate all the open source initiatives within the organization.

This is a simplified view of the layers of work in an OSPO. However, depending on the complexity of your organization and the resources available to your OSPO, these layers can become more granular and include additional layers with different names.

### The Pillars of Support

![ospo-support](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/assets/43671777/f96cd4a1-0315-4a0e-8de3-2da59378a57b)

* Open Source Enabler: OSPOs can help organizations navigate the cultural, process, and tool changes required to engage with the open source community effectively. This can involve educating teams/ units, establishing new processes and workflows, and adopting new tools and technologies.

* Open Source Counselor: OSPOs can provide guidance and advice on the latest open source trends, licensing issues, and how to engage with open source projects, foundations, and communities. This can help organizations stay up-to-date with the rapidly changing open source landscape and ensure they are making informed decisions.

* Open Source Advocate: OSPOs can promote the use and/or contribution of open source and best practices across different organizational units. This can help organizations realize the benefits of open source as well as engaging people to contribute to open source projects or start new ones.

* Open Source Environmentalist: OSPOs can help organizations support and sustain open source projects in the long term by addressing issues such as security, maintenance, and project health. This can involve establishing policies and procedures for code review, security vulnerability management, and ongoing maintenance and support through funding and/or contributions. By doing so, OSPOs can help ensure that open source projects remain healthy and continue to benefit the wider community.


## Creating and Implementing an Open Source Strategy

The way the people behind an OSPO achieve this is by creating and maintaining a framework covering the following aspects: strategy, governance, compliance, and community engagement. 
The OSPO's strategy focuses on aligning the organization's open source goals with its overall organization objectives.

A strategy creates a high-level consensus on concrete topics and their impact on your organization and the people within it. A good practice is to [document this strategy in an open source strategy document](https://todogroup.org/guides/strategy/).

It is recommended that this document includes a general Q&A section. Additionally, you may consider creating specific how-to guides for specialized areas that interact with the OSPO and open source projects (e.g., marketing, legal, engineering) to address specific challenges. These guides should be tailored to the domain knowledge of the team members involved.

### Making Open Source Relevant in the organization

Effectively executed OSPO work takes into account the elements of an organization's architecture, as understanding the organization's goals is fundamental for making 
informed open source-forward decisions:

![organization-architecture](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/assets/43671777/e722d9b0-04f7-4f0a-b645-fd369a2b56f9)

Since every organization is unique in its values, business drivers, and culture, it is challenging to provide specific content. However, addressing the following questions can help structure the document effectively:

* Which types of open source projects directly align with your organization's goals??
* Which specific practices can best foster a sustainable open source ecosystem?
* Which organization's processes have areas for improvement? 
* How can open source support those improvements? 
* How can you make workers champions for open source?
* How can the message be effectively transmitted to management for their understanding?





Moreover, it is important to [identify the open source projects and communities with which you will work](https://todogroup.org/guides/participating/). Developing a plan for how you will support these initiatives is crucial. Additionally, you will need to [consider the role that open source will play in your organization and how you will integrate open source solutions into your existing IT infrastructure](https://todogroup.org/guides/outbound-oss/).

### Making Open Source Relevant outside the organization

Organizations are subject to various external regulators that influence and shape their policies and processes. These regulators ensure compliance with legal requirements, ethical standards, and industry-specific guidelines. Some external regulators include:

* Government Agencies: Government bodies establish and enforce laws and regulations that impact organizations.
* Industry Regulators: Many industries have their own regulatory bodies or professional associations that set guidelines and standards for organizations to follow.
* Consumer Protection Agencies: Consumer protection agencies ensure that organizations provide fair and safe products or services to consumers.

In order for open source to be successful and sustainable within an organization, it is crucial to collaborate not only with the open source community but also with external regulators. This collaboration ensures a clear understanding of open source principles when creating policies that affect the ecosystem. The primary objective is to work together and make informed decisions by fully grasping the implications on open source and its community.

![collaboration-outside](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/assets/43671777/33b831ed-fbcd-42ad-bc62-a04d5467ddfc)


Consequently, when formulating strategies, it is essential for the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) to develop a plan on how to approach and communicate with these regulators, clearly defining the roles they will play in the policy-making process.


## Assessing Maturity of Open Source Program Office
`âœ… Assessment`

Many times, the OSPO may not be able to perform all these tasks at once and will need to assess the previous steps to successfully add new milestones to their roadmap. 
This is where [maturity models](https://linuxfoundation.org/tools/the-evolution-of-the-open-source-program-office-ospo/) come into play.

The [OSPO maturity model](https://linuxfoundation.org/tools/the-evolution-of-the-open-source-program-office-ospo/) can help organizations to understand the progress they are making towards building a mature OSPO, and to identify the areas where they need to focus their efforts.


* Awareness: This pre-stage represents the early phase of OSPO maturity. Organizations in this stage are exploring the potential benefits of open source. They typically experiment with open source solutions.

* Ad hoc: In the ad hoc stage, organizations start recognizing the value of open source and begin integrating it into their IT infrastructure. However, open source operations are still managed in an ad hoc manner, often on a case-by-case basis.

* Security, Education, and Strategy: At this stage, organizations aim to formalize their open source operations by establishing dedicated OSPOs to manage their open source activities. These OSPOs take responsibility for ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as developing and implementing open source strategies on how to use open source software in a sustainable way. This stage also contemplates the education on contirbuting to open source projects bu helping on its security adn sutainability.

* Community, Education, and Engagement: Organizations in this stage have mature OSPOs that oversee all aspects of their open source contributions and (if needed) and new open source projects. The OSPO is responsible for establishing best practices and standards for the open source projects they have activity. They ensure that all open source projects align with the organization's strategy and actively engage and sustain open source communities.

* Leader and Advisor: Open source is regarded as a critical component of the organization's IT infrastructure and open culture. The OSPO takes on the role of ensuring effective and efficient use and contribution of open source across the organization. They also manage relationships with open source communities and stakeholders, acting as a leader and advisor.
